## Description 
Our Chore Tracker Allowance App leverages the power of React and GraphQL to provide a cutting-edge tool for modern parenting.

Built on a React framework, it uses GraphQL for efficient data handling, ensuring a responsive and dynamic user experience. Apollo Client enhances the app's functionality, providing a powerful yet user-friendly platform to manage chores and provide allowances, making financial education both engaging and accessible for children.
