## Description 
Our Chore Tracker Allowance App leverages the power of React and GraphQL to provide a cutting-edge tool for modern parenting. This app not only streamlines household chore management by allowing parents to assign tasks and track completion, but it also makes the experience smooth and intuitive. Built on a React framework, it uses GraphQL for efficient data handling, ensuring a responsive and dynamic user experience. Apollo Client enhances the app's functionality, providing a powerful yet user-friendly platform to manage chores and provide allowances, making financial education both engaging and accessible for children.
